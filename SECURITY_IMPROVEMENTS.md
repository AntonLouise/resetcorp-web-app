# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented in the CSMS Web Application to address vulnerabilities and enhance overall system security.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials Removal
**Issue**: Email service credentials were hardcoded in the source code
**Risk**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access
**Solution**: 
- Moved all credentials to environment variables
- Added validation to ensure credentials are properly configured
- Enhanced error handling for missing credentials

**Files Modified**:
- `server/services/emailService.js`
- `server/config/security.js`

### 2. JWT Security Enhancement
**Issue**: Weak JWT configuration and hardcoded secrets
**Risk**: Token forgery, session hijacking
**Solution**:
- Enhanced JWT configuration with issuer, audience, and algorithm specification
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented proper token verification with error handling
- Added token expiration and refresh mechanisms

**Files Modified**:
- `server/utils/generateToken.js`
- `server/middleware/auth.js`
- `server/config/security.js`

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Issue**: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
**Risk**: Brute force attacks, DoS attacks
**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive rate limiting middleware
- Different limits for different endpoint types:
  - Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Email endpoints: 3 requests per hour
  - General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Added IP-based rate limiting with proper error messages

**Files Created**:
- `server/middleware/rateLimit.js`

## ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Security Issues Fixed

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization
**Issue**: Basic validation only, no sanitization
**Risk**: XSS attacks, injection attacks
**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive input validation using express-validator
- Added XSS protection with input sanitization
- Created validation rules for all user inputs
- Added field-specific validation with custom error messages

**Files Created**:
- `server/middleware/validation.js`

### 5. Password Security Enhancement
**Issue**: No password strength requirements
**Risk**: Weak passwords, brute force attacks
**Solution**:
- Implemented strong password policy validation
- Added password complexity requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Enhanced bcrypt configuration with configurable salt rounds

**Files Modified**:
- `server/models/User.js`
- `server/config/security.js`

### 6. Account Lockout Protection
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
**Risk**: Account compromise through repeated login attempts
**Solution**:
- Implemented account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- 2-hour lockout duration
- Automatic reset on successful login
- Enhanced login attempt tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `server/models/User.js`
- `server/controllers/authController.js`

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Security Issues Fixed

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling
**Issue**: Detailed error messages in production
**Risk**: Information leakage
**Solution**:
- Implemented environment-based error messages
- Added generic error messages for production
- Enhanced error logging with security context
- Added proper error classification and handling

**Files Modified**:
- `server/middleware/errorHandler.js`

### 8. File Upload Security
**Issue**: Basic file type validation only
**Risk**: Malicious file uploads
**Solution**:
- Enhanced file validation with MIME type checking
- Added file size limits (5MB)
- Implemented filename sanitization
- Added comprehensive error handling for upload failures

**Files Modified**:
- `server/config/upload.js`
- `server/routes/upload.js`

### 9. Security Headers Enhancement
**Issue**: Basic Helmet configuration
**Risk**: Various web vulnerabilities
**Solution**:
- Enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added comprehensive security headers
- Implemented CORS with proper restrictions
- Added XSS protection headers

**Files Modified**:
- `server/app.js`
- `server/config/security.js`

## New Security Features Implemented

### 10. Security Configuration Management
- Centralized security configuration
- Environment-based security settings
- Security validation on application startup
- Configurable security parameters

**Files Created**:
- `server/config/security.js`

### 11. Enhanced Authentication Middleware
- Improved token verification
- Better error handling for authentication failures
- Optional authentication for public endpoints
- Enhanced user status checking

**Files Modified**:
- `server/middleware/auth.js`

### 12. Comprehensive Logging
- Enhanced error logging with security context
- Request logging with IP and user agent tracking
- Security event logging
- Environment-based logging configuration

## Dependencies Added

### Security Packages
```json
{
  "express-rate-limit": "^7.1.5",
  "express-validator": "^7.0.1",
  "xss": "^1.0.14"
}
```

## Environment Variables Required
